''' Depth first search implementation on a dictionary
    Time Complexity: O(V+E)
    Space Complexity: O(V)
    Applications:
        - Finds the path quickly
        - Can find strongly connected components of a graph
        - Detects cycles in a graph
        - Not the optimal solution like BFS
